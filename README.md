A web Application to help the Teachers and Students Around Us in this Pandemic Situation
This project mainly focus on two section:
1. How to get connected with online tutors easily .
2. How to get connected with home tutors easily.

I created this platform to help our small childrens who are not getting education and multi-talented teachers living around us who loses their job all because of this pandemic situation. This pandemic took so many life and destroy the life of so many people and very badly effects the life of rural areas people who loses their work which was their only source of income and so many children left their study because of money crisis and in there familycannot afford their education expense.

I tried to find a solution for this problem:

1. Children who are looking for Home tutors and teachers who are willing to teach home tution:-

solution:- Teachers who are well knowledged and talented and are in need of job can easily get a job and students who are looking for the best home tutors can easily get connected with them according to their preferences without doing any expenses.

I created a section "connected with home tutors" which is divided in to another two section :

A. Be a mentor:- This section is for teachers to make their profile.
B. connect with mentor:- This section is for students to get connected with those mentors easily by searching through pinocde of their area.
All the teachers who created their profile all their data go into database and all the those data from databse get retrieve and display in connect with mentors page in a table and card layout so that students find it easy to choose best teacher for themselves.


2. Children who are looking for Online tutors and teachers who are willing to teach Online tution:-

solution:-Created a admin Dashboard and student dashboard where Online institute teacher will start their virtual classroom ,go through their account and can create form preferably using server scripting language PHP wherein you will be storing the data for courses,branch,update documents,view documents and generate questions paper through that for and once the data is stored, any student go through their account should be able to download a documents and their usefuly study resources aligned through the different classes and subjects, based on various parameters such as course, branch,semester,subject etc through a database using MYSQL.

I created a section "connected with online tutors" which is divided into another two section:

A. Teacher login:- Teacher will make their account and login through their account go to the admin dashboard where They will update all the documents and necessary data regarding their online study process same as people do earlier in offline classes where they used register to maintain everything reagarding their teaching process like their class routine ,students documents ,marks attendance etc. All these things now converted from register to this platform which help the teacher to maintain everything in organised way and also save their time.
Thorugh this platform teacher guide their students time to time without wasting each other time and get connected with each other all time.

B. Student Login:- students will make their account and login throygh their account and go to the student dashboard where they should be able to view and downloads all the documents and their usefull study resources aligned through the different classes and subjects, based on various parameters such as course, class,semester,subjects etc through a database using MYSQL.


This project is all about to help the teachers and students to get connected with each other in this COVID situation without sacrificing their study and jobs.
